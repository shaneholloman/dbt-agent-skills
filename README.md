# dbt Skills

A curated collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) for working with dbt. These skills help AI agents understand and execute dbt workflows more effectively.

## What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and use to do things more accurately and efficiently. This repository focuses specifically on dbt CLI operations and workflows.

- **Debug dbt issues**: Troubleshoot compilation errors, test failures, and performance problems
- **Manage dbt projects**: Handle dependencies, configuration, and project structure
- **Optimize dbt operations**: Use selectors, incremental models, and efficient testing strategies
